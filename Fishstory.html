 <h1>This is a Story</h1>
<h2>About me, just to know me a little bit better!</h2>
<hr>Well that is the hope at the very least.<hr>
<p>There was a river trip that I took with some friends, we had a grand ole time, but there was one instance where my friend caught a small fish and threw it onto a stone in the fire for a minute and dared me to eat it, <br> I agreed, </br> and proceeded to consume the small fish. It tasted like dirt but I did not fall ill, which was wonderful. </p>
